# Downloading SoilGrids V2 data

This repository contains some R scripts for downloading SoilGrids v2 data. Since the original tutorials provided by ISRIC does not work, I made a web scrapping algorithm for downloading directly from their webmapping service.

- `script_making_tile_indices.R`: Defines a bounding box and tiles size (in this case I was able to make up to 10 degree of Lat and Long), which can be exported as a gpkg layer for indexing. There is an edge buffer of around 0.01 degree.
- `script_soilGrids_download.R`: Downloads the SoilGrids data for different soil attributes and soil depths using the tile indices defined before.
- `script_debugging_with_thumbnails.R`: For any reason (perhaps internet connection), some tiles have problems and cannot be visualized. Therefore, this script identifies the problematic tiles for redownloading.
- `script_overviews_and_virtual_rasters.R`: Overviews and mosaicking of tiles can be made from this script.
